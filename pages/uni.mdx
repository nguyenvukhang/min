Career Compass
--------------

[tasks][career-compass]

"Assessment Tasks of HS1401S Career Compass I"

[what is compulsory][career-compass-requirements]

"Career Compass: The modules are compulsory and non-credit bearing (0
MCs). They can be completed at your own pace over 2 semesters. They
will be graded CS/CU and do not count towards the CAP. Nevertheless,
students will be tracked on the completion of tasks to ensure that
they are on the right track in their career preparation.

Career Catalyst: It is a 2 MCs, unrestricted elective module. It will
be graded CS/CU and do not count towards the CAP. Students are
encouraged not to drop the module though they are permitted to do so.
If they passed the Career Catalyst (CFG1002) module in Year 1, they
would have fulfilled a substantial part of the recommended tasks for
the first year Career Compass module (HS1401), which is compulsory for
all CHS students to take."
